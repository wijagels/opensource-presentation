\begin{frame}{The Four Freedoms of Free Software}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Freedom 0 is the freedom to run the program as you wish
    \item Freedom 1 is the freedom to study the source code and change it,
      so the program does your computing the way you wish
    \item Freedom 2 is the freedom to help others. That's the freedom to
      make exact copies and redistribute them when you wish
    \item Freedom 3 is the freedom to contribute to your community. That's
      the freedom to make copies of your modified versions, if you have made any,
      and then distribute them to others when you wish
